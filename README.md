KaSim is a stochastic simulator for rule-based models written in Kappa.

## Installation

To install you need ocaml native compiler. To check whether you have it, type 

`ocamlopt -version` 

Ocaml native compilers can be downloaded on [INRIA's website](http://caml.inria.fr/)

To create kaSim binaries, simply type 

`make`

This should produce KaSim binaries.

You will need your own plotting program (like gnuplot) to visualize curves.
