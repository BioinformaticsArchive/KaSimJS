Drawing a rule...
Applying 'A(x!_,y!0),B(x!0,y!_)->A(x!_,y!0),B(x!0,y)' with embedding:
[3,0,0]: [1->1,0->0]
Negative update as indicated by B#1 site 2
Negative update as indicated by A#0 site 1
Side effect on node 0 forces me to look for new embedding...
Trying to embed Var[1] using root 0 at node 0
New embedding: [1->1,0->0]
Should now try perturbations {}
