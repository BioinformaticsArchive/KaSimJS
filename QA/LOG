Var[5]: 'tick1' Tick(x~0) has 2 instances
	CC[0] #0 : [0->2]

Drawing a rule...
Applying 'tick1' with embedding:
[5,0,0]: [0->2]
Negative update as indicated by Tick#2 site 1
Influence map tells me I should look for new injections of var[1]
Trying to embed Var[1] using root 0 at node 2
reusing injection: [0->1]
New embedding: [0->2]
Influence map tells me I should look for new injections of var[4]
Trying to embed Var[4] using root 0 at node 2
reusing injection: [0->1]
New embedding: [0->2]
Should now try perturbations {}
